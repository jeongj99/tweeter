# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone that uses jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3 to build the front-end section.

This repository was a starter code for the project: I forked and clone this repository, then built upon it to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills. Node, Express back-end skills were already part of the template.
